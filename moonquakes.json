        "description": "The second largest group of lunar seismic events, accounting for around 13% of all identified events, are generated by impacts. These impacts can originate from natural meteoroids or artificial sources. Artificial sources include spent stages of Saturn-V launch vehicles and lunar modules intentionally directed at the lunar surface to create seismic sources with specific timing and location. Natural impacts, particularly meteoroids with masses smaller than 1 kg, tend to cluster in time, correlating with known meteor showers (Nakamura et al., 1982; Oberst and Nakamura, 1991)."
